Detailed description:
The map of Crystal Frenzy essentially consists of Nodes that you are able to attack and conquer. These Nodes are the Crystals that the Jabu seek to harvest, and each Node is then connected to various other Nodes that you can attack from. These Nodes all lead up to your main objective, the Life Crystal.

Crystal Frenzy plays out in 3 Phases, the Preparation Phase, Escort Phase and Defense Phase. You start the game in the Preparation Phase, with a Fortress as your first Node. You have to target a connected Crystal Node from your last conquered Node to attack, and assemble your army that you wish to attack with. 

In the Escort Phase, a Crystal Seeker, the Miner, is spawned from your last Node to attack your targeted Node, and waves of enemies spawn from the Node that you are attacking. The Miner automatically follows a preset path to the Node, and the Fursts will attempt to destroy your Miner, and you have to defend your Miner. You succeed if the Miner reaches the targeted Node, and you fail if the Miner gets destroyed.
If you succeed in the Escort Phase, you go back to the Preparation Phase, where you then have to select the next Node to attack, with the newly conquered Node acting as the new Node you attack from. If you fail, you enter a subphase of the Preparation Phase, the Preparation Defense Phase.

In the Preparation Defense Phase, you do not get to target any Nodes. Instead, you can only assemble your army. The Preparation Defense Phase leads to the Defense Phase, where the Fursts will send out their own Crystal Seeker to target your last conquered Node. Your objective now is to destroy their Crystal Seeker, and if you fail, the Fursts will start reclaiming their lost Nodes, until they reach your Fortress, and you lose. If you destroy their Crystal Seeker, you go back to the Preparation Phase and have to choose a Node to attack again. You win the game when you reach the final Crystal Node, the Life Crystal.
Each Crystal Node provides different random rewards every gameplay, and it is up to you to decide which reward to claim. Once you conquer a Crystal Node, you cannot conquer the other connected Crystal Nodes, so you have to choose wisely which path you take. Once ready, you will proceed to the Escort Phase. 

Certain Crystal Nodes contain Building Slots, where you can spend Gold to construct various buildings. Buildings either grant you access to new units, allow you to upgrade these units with Crystals, or allow you to assemble a larger army each Phase. Gold is gained from conquering Crystals, and Crystals is gained every time you enter a Preparation Phase. The amount of Crystals gained each Preparation Phase is increased by conquering Crystals.
