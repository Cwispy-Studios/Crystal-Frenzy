Used Tutorials
Simple Cartoon Water Shader by Brackeys (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg0L9aCRWPE)
Initially we set out to use custom shaders, however due to it interfering with other aspects of our game mechanics we decided to revert back to the Standard Unity Render Pipeline. Remnants of this can still be found within the game however, materials created with the shader were later translated into a texture. The molten material used in the Blacksmith is a customized version of this shader.
